      "impact": "Coaches can now provide extremely detailed player evaluations using comprehensive sub-attribute breakdowns. Each main attribute (Athletik, Aufschlag, Abwehr, Angriff, Mental, Positionsspezifisch) now contains 5 specific sub-attributes that automatically calculate the main value. This provides granular insights into specific skill areas, enabling more precise player development targeting. Position-specific attributes adapt based on player roles. The system maintains full backwards compatibility while dramatically enhancing evaluation depth and precision for volleyball coaching analytics."
